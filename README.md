Project Euler - jeek's attempt at writing code for project euler

I recently started over. Trying to keep the python code clean this time, and it also ties in to a local Jenkins server for some testing and the external https://travis-ci.org/jeek/projecteuler site for testing in other versions of python.

The goal this time around is clean code, proper commenting, and integration with other tools.
